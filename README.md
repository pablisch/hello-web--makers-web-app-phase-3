# Hello Web App

## Description

Barely an app at all, this is a simple exploration of the Sinatra framework, routes and ERB.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required gems using `bundle install`.
4. Run the app using `rackup`.

## Usage

The app can be used by navigating to `localhost:9292` in a web browser.

Each route in the app was designed to fulfill a specific purpose according to the challenges set out in phase three of the Makers Academy [Ruby Web Applications](https://github.com/makersacademy/web-applications) module.

There is no practical purpose beyond this since they are largely testing fabricated routes that require arbitrary parameters.

This is what you will find when you load the app:

<img src="images/hello.png" alt="Main page" style="width:450px">

That is why I recommend you find a more interesting repo to explore. It is not hard to do.
